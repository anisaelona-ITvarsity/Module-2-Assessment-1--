             <h3>PANDA</h3>
             <P></P>
          <strong><P>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></P>
          <P>Giant pandas have a distinctive black and white coat, with black fur around their
                 eyes and on their ears, muzzle, legs and shoulders. Their thick, wooly coat helps to keep them warm in their cool mountain homes.
                Adult pandas are about 150cm from nose to rump, with a 10-15cm tail.</P>
                <p>They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                <p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains</p>
