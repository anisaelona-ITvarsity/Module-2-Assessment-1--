           <h3>LION</h3>
           <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for 
               pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males 
               have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and
                color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones.</p>
                <P>utside of Africa, lions used to be found from Greece all the way to India.
                    Humans slowly decimated these populations over the centuries. Currently, only a small population of the Asiatic lion subspecies
                     can be found in the Gir Forest National Park in Western India.</P>
                     <strong><p>WHERE WILL I FIND THEM</strong></p>
                     <P>  lions could be found across the vast majority of Africa.</P>
