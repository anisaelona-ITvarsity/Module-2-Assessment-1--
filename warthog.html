             <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
             <p>Like their relatives, warthogs are plump, hooved animals with large nostrils at
                  the end of the snout. They have little fur, except for a mane that goes down the 
                  spine to the middle of the back, according to the Animal Diversity Web (ADW). 
                 Their tails also end with a tuft of hair. They have large teeth or tusks.</p>
