             <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
             <P>The Giraffe Family ruminants is distinguished by having only two 
                 fingers on each foot. It is the tallest animal in the world, with a neck long, 
                 a ridge descending and long legs. It has a couple of horns on the head about 10 inches.
                  dun brown cut by a network of yellowish lines clear.
                  Has a height of 5 to 6 meters and its weight reaches 1,180 kilos.</P>
                  <P>Whilst it was thought that giraffes did not make any sounds, this is now known to be untrue, as giraffes bellow, snort, hiss and make flute-like sounds,
                       as well as low pitch noises beyond the range of human hearing.</P>
                       <P>Giraffes spend most of their lives standing up; they even sleep and give birth standing up.</P>
                       <strong><P>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</strong></P>
                       <P>The South African giraffe is found in northern South Africa.</P>
