           <h3>KOALO</h3>
          <P>Koalas are well-known for their large round head,
               big furry ears and big black nose. Their fur is usually grey-brown in colour 
               with white fur on the chest, inner arms, ears and bottom. They have no fur on their nose or the palms of their paws.
               Koalas have poor vision and rely heavily on their other senses.</P>
               <P>They rely on the eucalyptus tree for both habitat and food.
                    Koalas can eat more than a pound of eucalyptus leaves a day.</P>
                <strong><p>WHERE WILL I FIND THEM</strong></p>
                <P>Their habitats are located on the mainland and on some islands on the east and southeast coast.</P>
